Hello everyone! Welcome to SciBlogs, a brand new research-oriented blog page hosted by Ivy Xiong. 

I am an early-career researcher dedicated to bring together genetics, bioinformatics and mathematics to understand the fundamental principles of cancer biology (find out more at my [personal research profile](https://lingyunxiong.github.io)). Now that I am about to start my independent research, I crave for a platform to publicize my scientific journey as it happens. Of course, we have many marvelous examples of great scientists in history to draw a lesson. (Once I attempted to explain my work to my family by citing Mary Curie, only to find their blank faces against my empty vanity.) However, wouldn't it be a great idea to share my research experience as well as my personal thoughts about the comtemporary issues in the scientific community while still fresh? Looking back, I do wish I had more examples I can relate to when I was entering graduate school! 

Therefore, I am launching this site today, with the purpose to demystify **the process of pursuing science** by personal accounts, and to raise awareness for the bias and prejudice that we trained scientists, as humans, inevitably bring into **the everyday practice of science**. After all, I think talking about the philosophy of science (i.e., how we approach or *frame* a natural phenomenon) is as important as scientific discoveries themselves. Both elements, I believe, are essential to our collective understanding of the world we live in. 

In addition, through open discussion and collegial debate, I hope the contents presented here will of some benefit to the broader audience. 

If you have any question of suggestion, please feel free to [Email me](mailto:u3502943@connect.hku.hk). Thanks for reading!
